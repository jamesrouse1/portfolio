# James Rouse's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository showcases two of my data science projects, each addressing unique and interesting challenges. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project.

## Project 1: Kidney Stone Prediction

### Overview
**Description:** This project focuses on predicting kidney stone presence based on urine data. Kidney stones are a painful health issue, and early detection can be crucial. I collected and cleaned a dataset containing urine characteristics and kidney stone diagnoses. After data cleaning, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data's characteristics.

### Key Highlights
- Utilized data visualization techniques such as box plots and violin plots to visualize variations in urine characteristics.
- Employed logistic regression for binary classification, emphasizing model evaluation metrics like accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and ROC curves.
- Introduced K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest for predictive modeling.
- Emphasized clear and informative data visualization throughout the project.

### Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create a practical tool for early kidney stone detection and intervention.

## Project 2: Predicting Player Performance in Baseball

### Overview
**Description:** In this project, I focused on predicting player performance in baseball, particularly their ability to drive in runs (RBIs). I collected hitting data for individual players and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between player statistics and RBIs.

### Key Highlights
- Identified the dominant role of home runs in predicting RBIs using machine learning and regression models, including Random Forest and Linear Regression.
- Explored the complexity of on-base percentage (OBP) and its impact on RBIs.
- Encouraged future research by suggesting avenues like incorporating additional variables and exploring new dimensions of player performance.

### Project Goal
The project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing a player's ability to contribute to offensive success in baseball, specifically in terms of RBIs.

## Real-World Applications
- Kidney Stone Prediction: Early detection and intervention for kidney stones.
- Baseball Player Performance: Informing player acquisition decisions for baseball teams seeking offensive firepower.
